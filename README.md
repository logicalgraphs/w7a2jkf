# w7a2jkf
Converts Western-style Shogi game records to 
[JKF (JSON Kifu Format)](https://github.com/na2hiro/json-kifu-format).

## libraries

* [w7a] Parses `file.w7a` and converts that file to [JKF](https://github.com/na2hiro/json-kifu-format)

## Revisions

* 0.01, 2026-01-01: Hand-convert part of a [w7a game 
record](https://www2.teu.ac.jp/gamelab/shogi/GAMES/54oi1.html) to JKF (comments
and two initial pawn-moves). Used 
[shogi-kifu-converter](https://github.com/sugyan/shogi-kifu-converter) to 
convert to KIF, which I then viewed in [lishogi](https://lishogi.org/pSUou8Lp).
